# My Quantified Self Set-up
When I published my inaugural  a week ago, I ended up getting a few questions about how I track various metrics. While I suspect this system will evolve over time, I can share what it looks like at the moment.

## ðŸ˜‰ WELLNESS


I'm planning on revising this spreadsheet annually, but right now the data spans 8 categories: Sleep, Wellness, Audience, Phone, Desktop, Fitness, Reading, and Location.

> Side note: I enjoy spreadsheet apps more in dark mode and since that functionality isn't available in Airtable yet, I've been using [Dark Reader](https://darkreader.org) as a solution. I like it a lot so far.
